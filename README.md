# 💬 Twitter Sentiment Analysis  

**Python | NLP | TF-IDF | Logistic Regression | Data Visualization**

Analyzed and predicted public sentiment from Twitter data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.  
The project uncovers how people express positive, negative, and neutral emotions about various brands and topics.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize tweet distribution, sentiment proportions, and popular entities.  
- Applied **NLP preprocessing** (cleaning text, removing stopwords, stemming, and tokenization).  
- Converted text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
- Trained and evaluated **Logistic Regression** for sentiment classification.  
- Visualized model performance through confusion matrix and word clouds.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- The dataset contained **72k+ tweets** across multiple topics such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple.  
- Majority of tweets expressed **positive sentiment**, with a smaller portion being negative.  
- The **Logistic Regression model** achieved strong accuracy on the test set.  
- **TF-IDF** features effectively captured linguistic patterns that distinguish sentiments.
